Welcome!  

I spent most of my undergraduate years in [Dr. Yuk Yin Ng](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/staff/yuk-yin-ng/)'s lab at Istanbul Bilgi University studying breast cancer and its subtypes using molecular and computational tools. Now, I am a [Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bioengineering](https://bio.sabanciuniv.edu/) MSc student studying the health of honey bees using transciptomics in the laporatory of [Dr. Christopher Mayack](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/cmayack/) at [SabancÄ± University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/), Turkey. 

My current interest is further elucidiating the effects of stressors such as pathogen infections and pesticide exposure on the gene expression profile of the anatolian honey bee, and identifying biomarkers for resistance against these stressors. My research is carried out using molecular tools and techniques sharpened during my undergrdaute years, and computational techniques and tools gained since the start of my MSc.
