Welcome to my personal academic website! My name is Haşim Hakanoğlu (Hashim Hakanolu), and I am a PhD student and research assistant at Louisiana State University (LSU) and LSU Agricultural Center (LSU AgCenter) working on advancing the health of honey bees using molecular biology and bioinformatics with [Dr. Qian Sun](https://www.qiansunlab.com/) from LSU AgCenter and Dr. Kate Ihle from the [USDA Honey Bee Breeding, Genetics, and Physiology Laboratory](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/baton-rouge-la/honeybeelab/).

My current research focuses on identifying biomarkers for resistance against diseases, particularly the infestation of the ectoparasitic mite <i>Varroa destructor</i>, and the roles of these biomarkers in promoting such resistance.
