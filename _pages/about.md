Welcome to my personal academic website! My name is Hasim Hakanoglu (Hachem Khankan), and I am a [Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bioengineering](https://bio.sabanciuniv.edu/) MSc student studying the health of honey bees using experimental (molecular biology) and computational approaches (transcriptomics, network analysis, and machine learning) in the laboratory of [Dr. Christopher Mayack](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/cmayack/) at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/). I am interested in two unrelated areas of research: cancer biology and honey bee health.

My interest in studying cancer started during my first summer internship in the [Laboratory of Genome Regulation](http://genreg.boun.edu.tr/) at Bogazici University, where I first received training in mammalian cell culture and several molecular biology techniques to study melanoma. My interest in the field of cancer biology has grown tremendously during my second summer internship in the laboratory of Dr. Ali Osmay Güre (previously Bilkent University, now Acibadem University), where I received training in bioinformatics to study breast cancer. I applied the knowledge and experience gained from both internships to further explore the differences in gene expression profiles of various subtypes of breast cancer both <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> for my undergraduate thesis uncer the supervision of [Dr. Yuk Yin Ng](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/staff/yuk-yin-ng/)’s lab at Istanbul Bilgi University.

My current research focuses on elucidating molecular mechanisms playing a role in resistance against infestation of the ectoparasitic mite, <i>Varroa destructor</i>, in honey bee lines that have been selected for that trait for over 15 years. My research is carried out mainly using computational tools and techniques to analyze RNA-seq data.
