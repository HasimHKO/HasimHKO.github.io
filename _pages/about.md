Welcome to my personal academic website! My name is Haşim Hakanoğlu (Hashim Hakanolu), and I am a [Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bioengineering](https://bio.sabanciuniv.edu/) MSc student studying the health of honey bees using transcriptomics in the laboratory of [Dr. Christopher Mayack](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/cmayack/) at [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/).

I spent most of my undergraduate years in [Dr. Yuk Yin Ng](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/staff/yuk-yin-ng/)’s lab at Istanbul Bilgi University training in various molecular biology techniques and mammalian cell culture. My interest in studying cancer started during my first summer internship in the [Laboratory of Genome Regulation](http://genreg.boun.edu.tr/) at Boğaziçi University, where I first received training in mammalian cell culture and several molecular biology techniques to study melanoma. My interest in the field of cancer biology has grown tremendously during my second summer internship in the laboratory of [Dr. Ali Osmay Güre](http://web2.bilkent.edu.tr/mbg/ali-osmay-gure/) at Bilkent University, where I received training in bioinformatics to study breast cancer. I applied the knowledge and experience gained from both internships to further explore the differences in gene expression profiles of various subtypes of breast cancer both in silico and in vitro for my undergraduate thesis.

My current interest is elucidating the effects of stressors such as pathogen infections and pesticide exposure on the gene expression profile of the Anatolian honey bee, and identifying biomarkers for resistance against these stressors. My research is carried out mainly using computational tools and techniques to analyze RNA-seq data. My end goal is to be able to integrate multi-omic data and adopt a systems biology approach to provide a holistic view and reach a deeper understanding of hallmarks and processes, subtypes and their distinct gene expression profiles, and their implication in drug response of heterogeneous cancers to facilitate personalized therapy.
